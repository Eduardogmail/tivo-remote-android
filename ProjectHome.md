**Project under construction.  Check back in about a week after everything is set up!**for

Use your android phone to control your TiVo series 3 (or later) DVR over your wireless network.

It's just like you were pressing buttons on the 'real' remote, but faster and with extra features:
  * enter text directly (no need to select letters with the arrow navigation one-by-one)
  * enable/disable CC with one click, set the 30s skip feature, toggle the on-screen clock

Pre-compiled/signed version will be published on the market for $0.99, but this project is open-source so you are welcome to build/install it manually for free, too!
